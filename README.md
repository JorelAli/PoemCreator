# PoemCreator
A program to help create special poems

## What is the PoemCreator?
The PoemCreator is a program I wrote which utilises the 3D property of [stereograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy) to embed secret messages into text. (See [hidden-3d.com](http://hidden-3d.com/index.php) for more examples on 3D stereograms). This program in particular is a form of [ASCII stereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_stereogram) which generates "text emphasis" stereograms which embed a secret message into a larger body of text.

## Basic Usage
* Download the latest .jar file from the [latest releases page](https://github.com/Skepter/PoemCreator/releases/latest)
* Add a title and your name as the author
* Write your text in the main box below. Adding a new line adds a paragraph to the final result
* Add the list of 3D words in the box below. These must match the words in the main text EXACTLY (case sensitive).
* Press GENERATE POEM to generate your poem
* The poem result will appear in the _Peom Output_ box. You can copy your poem to the clipboard by pressing _Copy poem to clipboard_

## Optional Usage
* Check the _Show Title in 3D_ box to show the title in 3D
* Check the _Show Author in 3D_ box to show the author's name in 3D
* Check the _Generate 4 column poem (as opposed to 2 columns)_ box to display four columns in the poem output. This still adds the words in the center column when viewed, but for inexperienced viewers, this can be more preferable.
