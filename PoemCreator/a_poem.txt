The tree's are speaking to me and I am listening to them talking to me because reasons. Trees cannot speak english or german or french or spanish or chech or parisian which is french but for crazy people.
The trees however do speak latin but I don't understand any latin. or rather not anymore not since the horto. There are trees in the horto but caecilluis is not there. therefor i no longer know how to speak latin. its very sad i wish i still knew latin so i could speak to the trees, ther are very interesting
The trees are great at giving advice i hear. the latin speakers tell me the trees really get them they always know exactly what to say. The latin students are snobs about the fact they can talk to the trees and i cannot. it isnt fair i want to talk to the trees.
The trees could tell me many many things they are full of knowledge they are so full of knowlege the that when they die and are flattened out they explode in words and numbers and facts. I wish i could talk to them so i could write down all these facts. If only i could speak to the trees the trees know all and i wish to know all.
Maybe i will one day speak to the trees
Maybe.

I don't know what to write
